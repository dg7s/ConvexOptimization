# Convex Optimization Repository

Welcome to the Convex Optimization Repository! This repository contains lab tasks and projects from my Convex Optimization class at Warsaw University.

## Labs 

All lab tasks from the Convex Optimization class are available in the [lab](https://github.com/dg7s/ConvexOptimization/tree/master/lab) folder of this repository.
The original course repository is available at this link [https://github.com/lkowalik/ConvexOptimization2024](https://github.com/lkowalik/ConvexOptimization2024).

## Homework

In addition to the lab tasks, you will find four homework assignments in this repository.

## Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- **lab/**: Contains lab tasks completed during classes.
- **homework1**: Theoretical task - proving the concavity of a function.
- **homework2**: Programming task "Max-Probability-of-Loss" from the "Additional Exercises" collection for the Convex Optimization textbook by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe.
- **homework3**: Programming task "Learning a Quadratic Pseudo-Metric from Distance Measurements" from the Convex Optimization textbook by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe.
- **homework4**: Implementation of Gradient Descent and Newton's Method for a given unconstrained problem from the Convex Optimization textbook by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe.
