# Convex Optimization Repository

## Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- **lab/**: Contains lab tasks completed during classes.
- **homework1**: Theoretical task - proving the concavity of a function.
- **homework2**: Programming task "Max-Probability-of-Loss" from the "Additional Exercises" collection for the Convex Optimization textbook by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe.
- **homework3**: Programming task "Learning a Quadratic Pseudo-Metric from Distance Measurements" from the Convex Optimization textbook by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe.
- **homework4**: Implementation of Gradient Descent and Newton's Method for a given unconstrained problem from the Convex Optimization textbook by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe.
