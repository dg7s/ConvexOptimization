# Convex Optimization Repository

Welcome to the Convex Optimization Repository! This repository contains lab tasks and projects from my Convex Optimization class at Warsaw University.

## Labs 

All lab tasks from the Convex Optimization class are available in the [lab](https://github.com/dg7s/ConvexOptimization/tree/master/lab) folder of this repository.
The original course repository is available at this link [https://github.com/lkowalik/ConvexOptimization2024](https://github.com/lkowalik/ConvexOptimization2024).

## Homework

In addition to the lab tasks, you will find four homework assignments in this repository. Each homework assignment is designed to reinforce the concepts learned in class and further develop your skills in convex optimization.

## Structure

- **lab/**: This folder contains lab tasks completed during classes.
- **homework1**: Theoretical task - proving the concavity of a function.
- **homework2**: Programming task "max-probability-of-loss" from the "Additional Exercises" collection for the Convex Optimization textbook by S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe.
- **homework3**: Homework assignment 3 soon.
- **homework4**: Homework assignment 4 soon.
